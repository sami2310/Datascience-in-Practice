    \hypertarget{context}{%
\subsection{Context}\label{context}}

    \textbf{For Telephone service companies, the cost of retaining an
existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.}

\textbf{As we were asked in the assignment we will focus on
understanding the customer base of the company and we will not be
interested in predicting churn at this point.}

    \hypertarget{data-type}{%
\subsection{Data type}\label{data-type}}

    \textbf{We started by looking at the data we had in hand:}

\textbf{Most of the features are categorical, most of the time
containing only two or three possible values. The only features that are
not categorical are : CustomerID, Monthly charges, Total charges and
Tenure.}

\textbf{We started our analysis by looking at these continuous features
and then looking at the categorical ones.}

    \hypertarget{exploratory-data-analysis}{%
\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}\label{exploratory-data-analysis}}

    \hypertarget{tenure}{%
\subsubsection{Tenure}\label{tenure}}

    \textbf{From the distribution of tenure we were able to derive the
following observations:}

\textbf{The Telco company has a very large number of new clients (25\%
of the customers have subscribed since less than 1year and 3months ago)
but also a very large number of ``old'' clients (25\% of the customers
have been with the company for more than 5years)}

\textbf{We can then say that the company is doing good in attracting new
customers but also in keeping the old ones}

\textbf{This analysis also tells us that this study have been conducted
for a period of 72/12 = 6 years, since it is the highest value of
tenure.}

\textbf{The large value that represents more than 10\% of the clients
having tenure equal to 6 years may be explained by the launching of the
Telco company which attracted a lot of users (probably because of a
launching deal).}

\textbf{The histogram of Tenure by payment also shows that most of the
new clients are choosing the month to month contract in contrast to the
old clients who were more likely to choose the 2years contract. This has
probably something to do with the deals offered by the company.}

    \hypertarget{monthly-charges-total-charges}{%
\subsubsection{Monthly Charges \& Total
Charges:}\label{monthly-charges-total-charges}}

    \textbf{From the histogram of monthly charges, we saw that the plot here
is skewed to the left which means that most clients have low monthly
charges.}

\textbf{From the histogram of Total charges,we saw that the total
charges decay exponentially, meaning that most of the clients pay small
charges. Indeed, more than 22\% of the clients paid less than 500 euros
as total charges}

\textbf{By calculating the pearson correlation coefficient, we saw that
it is equal to 0.75. This confirms our intuition that these two features
are highly positively correlated. A person who pays high monthly charges
also pays high total charges.}

    \hypertarget{gender}{%
\subsubsection{Gender :}\label{gender}}

    \textbf{From the distribution, we saw that the customer base is balanced
between male and female almost equally with a ratio of 50.7\% and
49.3\%.}

    \hypertarget{senior-citizens}{%
\subsubsection{Senior Citizens}\label{senior-citizens}}

    \textbf{The distribution shows that most of the clients of the data set
(almost 90\%) are below 50 years old.}

    \hypertarget{additional-services-correlation}{%
\subsubsection{Additional services \&
correlation}\label{additional-services-correlation}}

    \textbf{The distribution shows a balanced ratio 50\%/50\% of clients
opting for additional services and those who don't have them, when
chonsidering the clients that have internet service.}

\textbf{On contrary of what we could believe senior citizens have also
the same balanced ratio.}

\textbf{Moreover, we calculated a high correlation between some of the
additional services, for example Online security and Online backup. The
same applies for Streaming TV and Streaming movies.}

    \hypertarget{target-and-correlation-study}{%
\subsubsection{Target and Correlation
Study}\label{target-and-correlation-study}}

    \textbf{We wanted to know which features play a major role in predicting
the target feature (churn). So we looked closely at two of the features
from our data set and used chi-square tests to see if these features are
important to predict a customer's loyalty .}

    \textbf{We found that there is a relationship between Online Security
and loyalty to the company, where as the gender may not play a role in
